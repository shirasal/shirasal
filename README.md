- 👋 Hi, I’m @shirasal
- 👀 I’m interested in ecology through data science
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, SQL and how to build websites. In the meanwhile, I'm trying to do EVEYTHING in R, because _R is a language designed to get shit done_ (Hadley Wickham, rstudio::conf, 2022).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on visualisation projects, including creating maps.
- 📫 You can reach me via [email](mailto:shira.salin@gmail.com) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/shira_salin)
